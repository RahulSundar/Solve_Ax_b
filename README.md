# Code project
- Solve Ax=b
- A could be a dense or sparse matrix
- For a dense matrix
    - LAPACK for CPU solver
    - CuSolver for GPU solver
- For a sparse matrix
    - HYPRE for CPU solver
    - CUSP for GPU solver
- Objectives of the project
    - Practice LAPACK/HYPRE/CuSolver/CUSP
    - Practice of CMake with cuda
    - Practice of unit-test using C++11
