# Code project
- Solve Ax=b
- A matrix A could be a dense or sparse matrix
    - Symmetric or unsymmetric condition might be tested
    - Random matrix for unsymmetric conditions
- For a dense matrix of double-precision
    - LAPACK for CPU solver
        - dgesv for general/unsymmetric matrices
        - dsysv for symmetric matrices
    - CuSolver for GPU solver
        - cusolverDnDgetrf for general/unsymmetric matrices
        - cusolverDnDpotrf for symmetric matrices
- For a sparse matrix using MPI
    - HYPRE for distributed CPU solver
        - Flexible GMRES solver + AMG preconditioner
    - AmgX for distributed GPU solver
        - FGMRES + AMG preconditioner
- Objectives of the project
    - Practice LAPACK/HYPRE/CuSolver/AmgX
    - Practice of CMake with cuda
    - Practice of unit-test using CTest
    - Practice of C++11 or C++14 implementation
